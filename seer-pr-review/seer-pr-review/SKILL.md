# Seer-by-Sentry PR Comment Reviewer

This skill helps you systematically analyze, validate, and fix issues identified by the seer-by-sentry automated code review bot in GitHub Pull Requests.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User asks to "review seer comments" or "check seer-by-sentry feedback"
- User mentions a PR with automated review comments
- User wants to validate or implement fixes from automated review tools
- User asks about a specific seer-by-sentry comment
- User asks to check recent PRs for seer comments

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Determine Target PR(s)

**If PR number is provided:**
- Proceed directly to Phase 1 with that PR number

**If NO PR number is provided:**
1. **List Recent PRs**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --limit 10 --json number,title,author,updatedAt,headRefName
   ```

2. **Check Each PR for Seer Comments**
   For the most recent PRs (up to 5), check for seer-by-sentry comments:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
   ```
   Filter for comments from `seer-by-sentry[bot]`

3. **Present Options to User**
   If multiple PRs have seer comments:
   ```markdown
   Found seer-by-sentry comments on multiple recent PRs:
   - PR #42: "Fix authentication flow" (3 seer comments)
   - PR #38: "Update build script" (1 seer comment)

   Which PR would you like me to review? Or should I review all of them?
   ```

4. **Default Behavior**
   If only one PR has seer comments, automatically proceed with that PR.
   If no recent PRs have seer comments, inform the user.

### Phase 1: Fetch and Parse Comments

1. **Get PR Comments**
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
   ```

   Look for comments from user `seer-by-sentry[bot]` (login: `seer-by-sentry[bot]`, id: 157164994)

2. **Parse Comment Structure**
   Seer comments typically include:
   - **Summary**: Brief description of the issue
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the problem
   - **Suggested fix**: Concrete recommendation
   - **Severity**: Float value (0.0-1.0) indicating criticality
   - **Confidence**: Float value (0.0-1.0) indicating certainty
   - **File path**: Location in the PR diff
   - **Line number**: Specific line being flagged

3. **Organize by Priority**
   Sort comments by:
   - Severity √ó Confidence (highest first)
   - Breaking issues before warnings
   - Blocking issues (CI failures) before improvements

### Phase 2: Validate the Issue

For each comment, systematically verify:

1. **Understand the Context**
   - Read the relevant file sections using the Read tool
   - Check surrounding code for context
   - Review the PR diff to understand what changed

2. **Verify the Problem**
   - Does the issue actually exist in the current code?
   - Is the bot's analysis correct?
   - Check file paths and line numbers are accurate

3. **Assess Impact**
   - **Severity >= 0.8**: Critical - likely blocks functionality
   - **Severity 0.5-0.7**: Medium - causes issues but not blocking
   - **Severity < 0.5**: Low - minor improvements or nitpicks
   - **Confidence >= 0.9**: Very likely correct
   - **Confidence 0.7-0.8**: Probably correct, verify carefully
   - **Confidence < 0.7**: May be false positive, investigate thoroughly

4. **Risk Matrix**
   ```
   High Severity √ó High Confidence = FIX IMMEDIATELY
   High Severity √ó Low Confidence  = INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY
   Low Severity √ó High Confidence  = FIX IF TIME PERMITS
   Low Severity √ó Low Confidence   = LIKELY IGNORE
   ```

### Phase 3: Test the Analysis

Before implementing fixes, validate the bot's claim:

1. **Path Resolution Issues**
   - Verify file paths exist
   - Check for typos in paths or variable names
   - Confirm line numbers match current code

2. **Logic Errors**
   - Trace the execution flow
   - Check for edge cases mentioned
   - Look for similar patterns elsewhere in codebase

3. **Build/CI Issues**
   - Review CI workflow files
   - Check build scripts
   - Verify environment configurations

4. **Create a Reproduction**
   If possible, write a test case or scenario that demonstrates the issue

### Phase 4: Implement the Fix

When you've validated the issue is real:

1. **Checkout PR Branch**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin pull/{pr_number}/head:temp-branch-name
   git checkout temp-branch-name
   ```

2. **Apply the Fix**
   - Use Edit tool for targeted changes
   - Follow the suggested fix if it's correct
   - Improve upon the suggestion if needed
   - Maintain code style consistency

3. **Verify the Fix**
   - Re-read the modified file
   - Check that the change addresses the root cause
   - Ensure no new issues were introduced
   - Run relevant tests if applicable

4. **Commit the Change**
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "fix: address seer-by-sentry comment - <brief description>

   <detailed explanation of what was fixed>

   Resolves issue identified by seer-by-sentry bot.
   Severity: <severity>, Confidence: <confidence>

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

5. **Push to PR Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### Phase 5: Report Findings

Provide a structured summary:

```markdown
## Seer-by-Sentry Comment Review

### Comment Analysis
- **Location**: file_path:line_number
- **Issue**: <brief description>
- **Severity**: X.X (Critical/Medium/Low)
- **Confidence**: X.X (High/Medium/Low)

### Validation Result
‚úÖ VALID / ‚ùå FALSE POSITIVE / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY VALID

**Analysis**: <your assessment>

### Action Taken
‚úÖ FIXED / ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED / üîç NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Details**: <what you did or why you skipped>

### Impact
<explain what would have happened without the fix>
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Always verify the bot's analysis before implementing
- ‚úÖ Check severity AND confidence scores together
- ‚úÖ Read surrounding code for context
- ‚úÖ Test fixes when possible
- ‚úÖ Provide detailed commit messages
- ‚úÖ Reference the bot comment in your fix
- ‚úÖ Switch back to original branch after pushing fixes

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Blindly implement suggestions without validation
- ‚ùå Fix low-confidence issues without investigation
- ‚ùå Ignore high-severity warnings
- ‚ùå Make unrelated changes in the same commit
- ‚ùå Push directly to main/master
- ‚ùå Forget to switch branches after fixing

## Common Seer Issue Types

### 1. Path Resolution Errors
**Pattern**: Build scripts move files to wrong locations
**Example**: `mv file.tgz ../../wrong/path/`
**Validation**: Trace the path from the command's working directory

### 2. Missing Error Handling
**Pattern**: Functions that can throw but aren't wrapped in try/catch
**Validation**: Check if calling code handles errors

### 3. Race Conditions
**Pattern**: Async operations without proper awaits
**Validation**: Trace async/await chains

### 4. Type Mismatches
**Pattern**: TypeScript/type errors in builds
**Validation**: Check type definitions and usages

### 5. Configuration Issues
**Pattern**: Missing or incorrect config files
**Validation**: Check if config is read by the application

### 6. Security Vulnerabilities
**Pattern**: Exposed secrets, SQL injection, XSS
**Validation**: ALWAYS FIX - verify the vulnerability exists

## Handling False Positives

If you determine a comment is a false positive:

1. **Document Why**
   - Explain what the bot missed
   - Show why the code is actually correct
   - Provide evidence (logs, test results, etc.)

2. **Add a Comment to PR**
   ```bash
   gh pr comment {pr_number} --body "Seer comment at file:line appears to be a false positive because..."
   ```

3. **Consider Improving the Code**
   Even if not a bug, unclear code led to the false positive
   Consider refactoring for clarity

## Quick Reference

**Fetch PR comments**: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments`
**Get PR diff**: `gh pr diff {pr_number}`
**Checkout PR**: `git fetch origin pull/{pr}/head:branch && git checkout branch`
**Push fix**: `git push origin {branch-name}`
**Switch back**: `git checkout main`

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fetch comments
gh api repos/codyde/sentryvibe/pulls/38/comments > comments.json

# 2. Analyze each comment
# (use Read tool to view code, validate issues)

# 3. Checkout PR branch
git fetch origin pull/38/head:fix-branch
git checkout fix-branch

# 4. Apply fix
# (use Edit tool)

# 5. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: correct path in build script

Fixes path resolution issue identified by seer-by-sentry.
..."
git push origin fix-branch

# 6. Return to main
git checkout main
```

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ All comments analyzed and categorized
- ‚úÖ Critical issues (severity >= 0.8) addressed or documented
- ‚úÖ Fixes validated before committing
- ‚úÖ Clear commit messages explain the changes
- ‚úÖ PR updated with fixes

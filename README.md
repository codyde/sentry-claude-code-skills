# Sentry Claude Code Skills

A collection of Claude Code skills for enhancing your development workflow with Sentry and related tools.

## What are Claude Code Skills?

Skills are extensions that enhance Claude Code's capabilities by providing specialized workflows, domain knowledge, and automated processes. They're automatically loaded by Claude when relevant to your task.

## Available Skills

### üîç Seer-PR-Review

Systematically analyze, validate, and fix issues identified by the seer-by-sentry automated code review bot in GitHub Pull Requests.

**Features:**

- Validate whether issues are real or false positives
- Assess severity and confidence scores
- Implement fixes for verified issues
- Provide detailed analysis reports

**Use cases:**
- "Review seer comments on PR #38"
- "Fix the issues identified by seer on PR #42"
- "Is the seer comment about the build path actually a problem?"

## Installation

### Quick Start: Install All Skills

Install all available skills at once:

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd ~/.claude/skills/
git clone https://github.com/codyde/sentry-claude-code-skills.git

# Run the installation script
cd sentry-claude-code-skills
./install-all.sh
```

The script will:
- Check for prerequisites
- Install each skill to `~/.claude/skills/`
- Verify installation success
- Provide next steps

### Individual Skill Installation

To install a specific skill:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codyde/sentry-claude-code-skills.git
cd sentry-claude-code-skills

# Navigate to the skill directory
cd seer-pr-review/seer-pr-review

# Run the skill's install script
./install.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Copy skill to Claude skills directory
cp -r seer-pr-review/seer-pr-review ~/.claude/skills/seer-pr-review
```

## Prerequisites

Before installing skills, ensure you have:

- **Claude Code** with skills support
- **Git** installed and configured
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed and authenticated (for seer-pr-review)

### Installing GitHub CLI

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install gh

# Windows
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

## Usage

Once installed, skills are automatically invoked by Claude when relevant. You can also explicitly invoke them:

### Automatic Invocation

Simply mention the skill's domain in your request:

```
"Review the seer-by-sentry comments on PR #38"
"Check if the seer feedback on this PR is valid"
```

### Manual Invocation

Use the skill command:

```
/skill seer-pr-review
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md          # Required: Skill definition
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Usage documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ INSTALL.md        # Installation guide
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EXAMPLES.md       # Real-world examples
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QUICKREF.md       # Quick reference
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.sh        # Installation script
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE           # License file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Repository info
```

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that skills are loaded:

```bash
# Check installed skills
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/

# You should see:
# - seer-pr-review/
```

Then test in Claude Code:

```
"Review seer comments on PR #[number]"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading

1. Verify SKILL.md exists in `~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/`
2. Check file permissions: `chmod 644 ~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Try explicit mention: "Use the [skill-name] skill"

### GitHub CLI Issues

```bash
# Check if gh is installed
gh --version

# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth login
```

### Git Issues

```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
git status

# Stash changes if needed
git stash
```

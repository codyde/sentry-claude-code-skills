# Sentry Claude Code Skills

A collection of Claude Code skills for enhancing your development workflow with Sentry and related tools.

## What are Claude Code Skills?

Skills are extensions that enhance Claude Code's capabilities by providing specialized workflows, domain knowledge, and automated processes. They're automatically loaded by Claude when relevant to your task.

## Why not just make more MCP tools?

**Skills and MCP tools serve different purposes.** MCP tools connect Claude to external services and data sources (databases, APIs, monitoring platforms), while Skills package domain expertise and workflows directly into Claude's decision-making process. **Skills are automatically invoked by Claude when contextually relevant, whereas MCP tools require explicit calls‚Äîthink of Skills as "teaching Claude how to think about a problem" versus MCP tools as "giving Claude access to external systems."**

## Available Skills

### üîç Seer-PR-Review

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd ~/.claude/skills/
git clone https://github.com/codyde/sentry-claude-code-skills.git

# Run the installation script
cd sentry-claude-code-skills
./install-all.sh
```

The script will:
- Check for prerequisites

### Individual Skill Installation

To install a specific skill:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codyde/sentry-claude-code-skills.git
cd sentry-claude-code-skills

# Navigate to the skill directory
cd seer-pr-review/seer-pr-review

./install.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Copy skill to Claude skills directory
cp -r seer-pr-review/seer-pr-review ~/.claude/skills/seer-pr-review
```

## Usage

Once installed, skills are automatically invoked by Claude when relevant. You can also explicitly invoke them:

### Automatic Invocation

Simply mention the skill's domain in your request:

```
"Review the seer-by-sentry comments on PR #38"
"Check if the seer feedback on this PR is valid"
```

### Manual Invocation

Use the skill command:

```
/skill seer-pr-review
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
